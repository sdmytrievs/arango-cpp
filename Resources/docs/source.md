## Coments
Done

3. Add time test for driver

4. Work about time decrements  (research methods and curl problems)

    - curl could be init and only chage curl requests
    - All options could not be set all time: user pathword ...


To Do


2. Add google tests for driver (research before best practices )
   - test crud   +
   - test selection
   - test query params
   - test local root commands
   - test graph commands
   - run test for remote
   - read test data from config file


5. Add the same test examples for pyArango and compare time execution

6. Into ArangoDBCollectionAPI no example for queryEdgesToFrom and removeEdges
   more detail implement and test graph commands
